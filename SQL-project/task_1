So please write a query to find records where the subject_quality_score is 10 -- only looking for home taps -- and where the source
was visited a second time. What will this tell us?
SELECT *
FROM water_quality
WHERE subjective_quality_score = 10
  -- AND source_type = 'home tap'
  AND visit_count = 2;
218 rows of data are there in this query!
So, write a query that checks if the results is Clean but the biological column is > 0.01.
use md_water_services;
SELECT *
FROM well_pollution
where results = 'Clean' 
  AND biological > 0.01;
64 rows
Hint: To find these descriptions, search for the word Clean with additional characters after it. As this is what separates incorrect descriptions from the records that should have "Clean".
use md_water_services;
SELECT *
FROM well_pollution
where description LIKE 'Clean_%' 
 AND biological > 0.01;
